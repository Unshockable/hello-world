# hello-world
Yet another hello world program.  

Hi everyone.  My name is Magnus.  Programming has been part of my life since I was eight years old.  I'm an engineer by trade and training, and my code has been put into devices all over the world.  

I like earth tacos.  I almost always have tacos on Tuesday and even have taco socks.  

That sounds like an insane non-sequitor unless you also read the tutorial.
